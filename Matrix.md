# The Matrix 

The Matrix Milestone requires that we have at least:

-   supports EKS, AKS, GKE, Microk8s, K3s, OKD
-   installs in Kubernetes with the single command: 
-   provides out of the box services like databases, object storage and cache
-  it has a consistent set of runtimes that can use additional services
